# Coulomb-CUBE
# **MQ_MZ_Ejection_SingleQ**

A simple program in **Processing** and **Java** that computes the destribution of a potential fron a billion charges randomly positioned within a cube with a side a. Outputs a table of potential along the line intersecting the cube from one site to another through the center. Helps to esimate space charge created by  more than 10^9 ions confined in the MultiQ.


### 1. **Download Files**
