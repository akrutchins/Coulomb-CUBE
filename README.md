# **Coulomb-CUBE**

**Coulomb-CUBE** is a simple program written in **Processing** and **Java** that calculates the distribution of an electric potential generated by a billion charges randomly positioned within a cube of side length `a`. The program outputs a table of the potential along a line passing through the cube's center from one side to the other. It is useful for estimating the space charge created by ions confined in the MultiQ system.

---

## **Features**
- Computes the potential distribution from \(10^9\) charges within a cubic volume.
- Outputs the potential values along a central axis line intersecting the cube.
- Assists in analyzing space charge effects in systems such as MultiQ ion traps.

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Download Files**
- Download all `*.pde` files.
- Place them in a folder named `Coulomb-CUBE` on your computer.

### 2. **Install Processing**
- Install **Processing 4.3** (latest version as of December 2024).
- Earlier versions may work but are untested.
- Supported operating systems:  
  - **Windows 11**  
  - **Linux**  
  - **MacOS**

### 3. **Run the Program**
1. Open `Coulomb-CUBE.pde` in Processing.
2. Run the program to open the **Coulomb-CUBE** canvas window.

## **Usage Notes**
- Ensure the cube parameters (e.g., side length `a`) are correctly defined in the program.
- The output file will contain a table of potential values along the specified axis.
- This program is designed to handle large datasets efficiently, but performance may vary depending on your hardware configuration.

## **Additional Notes**
- Contributions or suggestions to improve the program are welcome.
- Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs or applications.
